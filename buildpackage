How to build an hpkg.


First, you build a control.

vi <package_name>.control



-------------------------------


BIN_FILE= <Binary Application>
BIN_PATH= <Binary Application's Path>
DEPLIST= <List of Dependencies to install>
PKGVER= <Package Version>
CONSCRIPT= <Control Script. Basically moves all files to the right place and does proper updates of other registries.>


-------------------------------



Once the control is built, place it in the directory with the rest of your package data.

Directory Contents for the package should look like this.

# ls package_dir

<binary>
<Library Folders>
<Desktop Entry>
<Control Script>



Create the package by cd'ing one directory before the package directory... and executing this command.


tar -cjvf package.hpkg package_dir/*


Congrats, HPKG built!
