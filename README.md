=Hybrid Package Manager=


Hybrid Package Manager is the default Package Manager for Descent|OS 5.0 and beyond. It is written in a "Hybrid" design, in both Ruby and sh.
The Hybrid design also encompasses the Package Manager's functionality, utilizing ways to install binaries from a repository, local packages, and from source either locally or from a package build script, similar to Slackbuilds.
Packaging for hpkg is quite straightforward, and similar to Debian's functions, albeit with major differences. Please refer to the buildpkg man page for more details.

Hpkg is MIT licensed, and will remain free and open source to the public.


Enjoy the future of package management and of Linux!
